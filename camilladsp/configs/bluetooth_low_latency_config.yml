  Sub:  Impulse response from 10/8 speaker measurements and 10/22 filter creation.
  Recomputed 12/19/2024 for 176.4 KHz sample rate.

    # This way of connecting to Bluetooth is, at the least, suboptimal.
    # We're reading the audio routed to (I think) the default audio
    # output device by BlueZ or PipeWire.  That means we also read
    # anything else routed to that device, which might be very loud.
    # The method described in the CammilaDSP README
    # uses Bluezalsa directly, but that software is still unstable.
    # Also, I don't think PulseAudio is actually running on the 
    # music server.  PipeWire is definitely there, and I think we're
    # actually using its PulseAudio compatibility features.

    # RME Digiface USB.  Channels 0 and 1 are mains, 2 and 3 are sub.  
    # The Digiface USB supports different sample rates depending on how many inputs
    # and outputs are in use.  The current (2024) Linux sound drivers only allow
    # 44.1 KHz to be selected if all 34 channels are in use.  We output silence to
    # the unused channels.

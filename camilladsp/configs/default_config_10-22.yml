title: "Subwoofer crossover with 10/22 mains and sub filters"
description: >
  Mains:  10/30 minimum Phase FIR, processed using "important note" method and not 
  incorrectly adding in the crossover correction.  Recomputed 12/19/2024 for 176.4 KHz
  sample rate.
  Currently just using the L filter.
  Sub:  Impulse response from 10/8 speaker measurements and 10/22 filter creation.
  Recomputed 12/19/2024 for 176.4 KHz sample rate.

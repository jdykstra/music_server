title: "Subwoofer crossover with 10/22 mains and sub filters"
description: >
  Mains:  10/30 minimum Phase FIR, processed using "important note" method and not 
  incorrectly adding in the crossover correction.  Recomputed 12/19/2024 for 176.4 KHz
  sample rate.
  Currently just using the L filter.
  Sub:  Impulse response from 10/8 speaker measurements and 10/22 filter creation.
  Recomputed 12/19/2024 for 176.4 KHz sample rate.

devices:
  capture_samplerate: 48000
  # High sample rate to allow for high quality filtering.
  # Current value is 4*capture_samplerate.

  chunksize: 8192
  # Increase target level to avoid underruns.  Current value is 
  # max alllowed;  it probably could be less.

    # This way of connecting to Bluetooth is, at the least, suboptimal.
    # I think we're reading from a stream really meant to be used for 
    # monitoring an PA sink.  The method described in the CammilaDSP README
    # uses Bluezalsa directly, but that software is still unstable.
    # The comments below are mainly from Copilot and may or mayno be correct.
    # Read from bluetooth device.  This is the monitor device for the
    # bluetooth device.  The actual device is "bluealsa:DEV=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,PROFILE=a2dp".
    # It is not possible to use the bluetooth device directly as the capture device
    # because the bluetooth device does not support the required sample rate.
    # The monitor device is a virtual device created by bluealsa that allows
    # the bluetooth device to be used as a capture device.
    # The monitor device is not available in the alsa device list.
    # It is found from "pactl list sources short"
